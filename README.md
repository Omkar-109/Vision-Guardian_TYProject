## Hardware Setup

The hardware setup consists of:
- **ESP32 Sensor**: For communication via Bluetooth.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: For detecting obstacles.
- **Battery and TP4056 Module**: To power the device.

The hardware is encased in a **3D-printed, lightweight, and durable casing**, ensuring users can move freely and confidently.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Object Detection**: SSDMobileNet TensorFlow Lite
- **Voice Assistant**: ChatGPT API (NOVA)
- **Bluetooth Communication**: ESP32 Microcontroller with Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python
- **Platform**: Android

---

## How It Works

1. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles and sends the data to the app via Bluetooth. 
2. **Object Detection**: TensorFlow Lite identifies objects in the environment.
